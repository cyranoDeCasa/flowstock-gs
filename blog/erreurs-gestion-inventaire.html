    <p>Poor inventory management can be costly for your business. Here are the most common mistakes we see among
        retailers and SMEs — and how to avoid them.</p>

    <h2>1. Not Tracking Stock Movements in Real Time</h2>
    <p>Many businesses still rely on weekly or monthly reports. The result: unexpected stockouts. With FlowStock,
        movements are recorded instantly.</p>

    <h2>2. Lack of Visibility on Dormant Products</h2>
    <p>Some products remain in stock for months without being sold. It's crucial to monitor these items and adjust
        your orders accordingly.</p>

    <h2>3. Poor Communication Between Departments</h2>
    <p>When inventory management isn't connected to sales or purchasing, errors accumulate. FlowStock facilitates
        collaboration through a shared dashboard.</p>

    <h2>4. Incorrect Reorder Thresholds</h2>
    <p>Not setting minimum stock levels leads to either stockouts or overstocking. Configure automatic alerts to
        prevent this.</p>

    <h2>5. Ignoring Reports and Analytics</h2>
    <p>Data is valuable! Failing to analyze sales and stock movements prevents optimization.</p>

    <p>✅ Using a proper tool like FlowStock makes these mistakes easy to correct, keeping your inventory under
        control.</p>
